# ds-capstone-movielens

This is my movielens project for the EdX course 'Data Science: Capstone' from HarvardX (PH125.9x).

The project creates a prediction model to predict users' movie reviews.

Along with the PDF report, this repo includes the code used to generate the report - both in R Markdown and as an R script.
